# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing LLM chat application to support Amazon Bedrock models alongside the current Ollama and Groq options. Users will be able to select Bedrock as their LLM provider and interact with various foundation models available through the Amazon Bedrock service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Amazon Bedrock models into the chat application, so that I can leverage AWS's foundation models for my conversational AI needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sets `llm_picker` to "bedrock" THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock for generating responses
2. WHEN using Bedrock THEN the system SHALL authenticate using AWS credentials
3. WHEN using Bedrock THEN the system SHALL support configuring the model ID via environment variables or code configuration
4. WHEN using Bedrock THEN the system SHALL handle API errors gracefully with informative error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to easily switch between different LLM providers (Ollama, Groq, and Bedrock), so that I can compare their performance and choose the best option for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user changes the `llm_picker` variable THEN the system SHALL use the corresponding LLM provider
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate that the required credentials for the selected provider are available
3. IF required credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message indicating what configuration is needed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper documentation on how to set up and use the Bedrock integration, so that I can quickly get started with minimal friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user clones the repository THEN the README SHALL include clear instructions for setting up AWS credentials
2. WHEN a new user clones the repository THEN the README SHALL include examples of how to use different Bedrock models
3. WHEN a new user clones the repository THEN the .env.example file SHALL include the necessary environment variables for Bedrock configuration
